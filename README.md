# ~~afghan~~braid-planner

This was originally intended as a planner for colorful crochet blankets made of squares, a.k.a afghans, but currently the most finished version of this is actually a planner for kute-uchi AADC loop braids. It lets you pick the starting colors for each loop half and visualise the resulting braid pattern. More information on the website itself at https://braid.lydie.nz
